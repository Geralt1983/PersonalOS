This is the right move. Using the "High Thinking" (Agent) mode is perfect for a complete architectural overhaul like this because it can handle multiple file dependencies at once without you having to manually copy-paste ten different files.
Here is the "God Prompt" to paste into the Agent. It contains the full context, the dependencies, and the specific code for the "Billion Dollar" aesthetic we designed.
The "God Prompt" for Sanctuary OS
Copy and paste this entire block into the AI Agent:
> Act as a Senior Frontend Architect. I need a complete overhaul of my Next.js application "Sanctuary OS" to achieve a "Billion Dollar App" aesthetic.
> The Goal: A dark, OLED-friendly personal dashboard using "Organic Steel" aesthetics, physics-based animations, and a local-first feel.
> Dependencies to Install:
> Please run: npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
> Architecture Changes:
>  * Navigation: Replace the sidebar/grid with "The Deck" (a floating macOS-style dock at the bottom).
>  * Header: Replace the text header with "SystemHUD" (a minimal status bar).
>  * Visuals: Wrap all cards in a "SpotlightCard" component (mouse-following halo effect).
>  * Layout: Use a scroll-to-view section layout driven by The Deck.
> Implementation Details (Use this specific code):
> 1. app/globals.css (The Texture)
> Add a noise texture and P3 colors:
> @import "tailwindcss";
> :root {
>   --background: #050507;
>   --foreground: #f5f5f5;
> }
> body {
>   background-color: var(--background);
>   color: var(--foreground);
>   background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 200 200' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='noiseFilter'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.65' numOctaves='3' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23noiseFilter)' opacity='0.03'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
> }
> 
> 2. components/ui/spotlight-card.tsx (The Halo)
> Create this component. It tracks mouse movement to create a glowing border effect using framer-motion.
> 3. components/the-deck.tsx (The Navigation)
> Create a floating dock at the bottom center.
>  * Imports: lucide-react (Activity, Anchor, BrainCircuit, Hammer).
>  * Animation: Use framer-motion for magnification on hover (scale 1.1).
>  * Props: Accepts currentView and onChangeView function.
> 4. components/system-hud.tsx (The Header)
> Create a fixed top bar with transparent background.
>  * Left: "Sanctuary_OS v1.0" (Monospace font).
>  * Right: Time and Battery icon.
> 5. components/vitality-gauge.tsx (The Hero)
>  * Wrap in SpotlightCard.
>  * Implement "Breathing" animation on the central orb using framer-motion (scale up/down).
>  * States: Low (Cyan), Medium (Blue), High (Purple).
> 6. components/the-anchor.tsx (Habits)
>  * Wrap in SpotlightCard.
>  * Use spring physics for the toggle switches.
> 7. components/brain-dump.tsx (Input)
>  * Wrap in SpotlightCard.
>  * Input field should be text-base to prevent iOS zoom.
> 8. app/page.tsx (The Layout)
>  * Layout: SystemHUD fixed at top. TheDeck fixed at bottom.
>  * Main: A scrollable container holding the sections (gauge, anchor, brain, construct).
>  * Logic: Clicking an icon in TheDeck should scroll the specific section into view (ref.scrollIntoView).
> Execution:
> Please implement these files and ensure the layout is responsive (mobile-first approach: Deck at bottom, content vertically stacked).
> 
What happens next?
The Agent should read this, realize it needs to install framer-motion, and then systematically rewrite your page.tsx and create the component files.
Once it finishes, hit the Run button. You should see the floating dock at the bottom. Hover over it to test the physics.
